To address this topic, it examines some of the most significant trends in contemporary Latin American filmmaking, including the emergence of the thriller as a preferred genre to address the legacies of the 1960s and 1970s; the rise of "youth" films about globally-connected and disaffected young adults; and the proliferation of transnational productions by "traveling" filmmakers that encourage audiences to feel for "others." The book features close textual analysis of individual films from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Mexico; as well as commentary on the changing structure of Latin American film industries. It frames those analyses within a discussion of recent critical and theoretical debates about affect, sentimentalism and compassion, particularly as they relate to film. 0aMotion pictureszLatin America. 0aEmotions in motion pictures.4 3Palgrave Connectuhttp://www.palgraveconnect.com/doifinder/10.1057/9780230120112x05zAn electronic book accessible through the World Wide Web; click for access  bHISTm99nMatt Bushq1vALEXSzELECTRONIC
